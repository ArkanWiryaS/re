## Title

**Verdant: Sustainable Industrial Development Platform with AI-Powered Health Monitoring System**

---

## Problem

Indonesia faces significant challenges in achieving balanced industrial growth with environmental sustainability, particularly in implementing UN Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure). Current market research indicates that **78% of innovative ideas fail to reach implementation** due to lack of proper funding connections, while **65% of impact investors struggle to find verified sustainable projects**.

Additionally, the post-pandemic era has highlighted the urgent need for **workplace safety monitoring solutions** that can ensure health protocol compliance without compromising worker privacy or requiring expensive infrastructure investments. Traditional monitoring systems are often inaccessible to SMEs, which represent 99.9% of businesses in Indonesia.

There is a critical need for an integrated digital platform that can:

1. Connect innovators with investors in the sustainable development ecosystem
2. Demonstrate practical implementation of smart technology for workplace safety
3. Provide privacy-first, browser-based AI solutions accessible to all business scales
4. Support Indonesia's transition toward sustainable industrial development

## Conclusion

This User & Task Analysis provides comprehensive foundation for the Verdant platform development, clearly defining two primary user classes (Innovators and Investors) with their specific goals, needs, and interaction patterns. The analysis identifies six core use cases that address the platform's mission of connecting sustainable development stakeholders while providing cutting-edge AI technology demonstration.

The task analysis reveals that both user types share common information-gathering and evaluation needs, while having distinct action-oriented tasks (innovation submission vs. investment submission). This insight supports the platform's design as an integrated ecosystem that serves multiple stakeholder types effectively.

The use case analysis demonstrates how the platform facilitates the complete user journey from initial discovery through formal partnership establishment, ensuring comprehensive support for sustainable industrial development in Indonesia.
